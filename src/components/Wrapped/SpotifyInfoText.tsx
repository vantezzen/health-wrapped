        Wrapped for Apple Health can play fitting songs during your Wrapped
        using the Spotify Player.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have Spotify Premium, simply log in to your Spotify in your
        browser - no need to connect your account to Wrapped for Apple Health!
        Wrapped for Apple Health won't have access to your Spotify data, but
        simply embed the Spotify Player.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you don't have Spotify Premium, you can still fully use Wrapped for
        Apple Health - just without the music.
